# Product Decision: NCBI BLAST+ behaviour that is a defect

- Decision ID: `PD-LOSAT-NCBI-DEFECTS`
- Version: 1.3
- Date: 2026-10-02 (1.0); 1.1 the same day (the three confirmations below, Session S07+++b);
  1.2 2026-10-03 (exception 2 for TBLASTX and TBLASTN, Session S08b); 1.3 2026-10-05
  (BLASTP, TBLASTN and TBLASTX of stage E2e: exception 3 and the items below, Session S08+b)
- Status: Accepted by the maintainer on 2026-10-02, in Session S07+++b (E2g), on the
  NCBI BLAST+ 2.17.0 behaviours that the BLASTN inventory
  (`docs/evidence/losat_web_e2g/INVENTORY.tsv`) and the independent audits found to be
  defects. Plan decision DW-15 in [`docs/losat_web_gui_plan.md`](../losat_web_gui_plan.md).

## Scope

NCBI BLAST+ 2.17.0 behaviour that is a defect rather than a design: a crash, an
exception that only a debug-build assertion was meant to prevent, a read past the end of
a buffer, or an integer that wraps. Everything else stays under the root
[`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) bit-perfect rule. Versions 1.0 and 1.1 list the BLASTN
items; version 1.2 adds TBLASTX and TBLASTN; version 1.3 the BLASTP, TBLASTN and TBLASTX
items of their non-default options (E2e); BLASTX adds its own in its session under the same
rule.

## Rule

1. **NCBI fails, and LOSAT can give a valid result:** an approved exception. The result
   is valid when it equals NCBI's output for a nearby input or configuration that does
   not reach the defect (evidence under `docs/evidence/`).
2. **NCBI gives a deterministic result, even one that looks wrong:** LOSAT reproduces it
   byte for byte. This is not an exception. The maintainer may keep an explicit rejection
   instead for a setting without a practical use whose reproduction is costly (version
   1.1: the two items so marked below).
3. **NCBI fails, and no valid result can be defined or checked:** an explicit rejection
   ("... is not supported by LOSAT's BLASTN"). This is not an exception.
4. **NCBI accepts an input deterministically that LOSAT rejected:** LOSAT ports it.

## Approved exceptions (BLASTN)

1. **A query chunk that NCBI would split again.** With `CHUNK_SIZE` and
   `OVERLAP_CHUNK_SIZE` such that a query chunk is long enough to be split again (an
   overlap close to the chunk size), NCBI skips the chunk's lookup table and stops with a
   `CCoreException` (null pointer) that names its build's source files, exit 3
   (`split_query_aux_priv.cpp:190-201`, `blast_aux_priv.cpp:206-208`; only a debug build
   asserts against it). LOSAT searches each chunk once. Evidence
   `docs/evidence/losat_web_e2g/resplit/`: 42 configurations (3 queries of 30 to 60 kb,
   blastn and megablast, 7 chunk and overlap pairs); NCBI exit 3 in all; LOSAT's output
   equals NCBI's unsplit output in 35, and NCBI's output at the largest overlap that does
   not split a chunk again in 74 of 84 runs (outfmt 6 and 0). The 10 others differ only
   by the HSPs at chunk boundaries that NCBI's own splits also lose. The round-3 audit
   (`~/.cache/losat-web-gui-target/e2g-audit/r3b/`): 61 of 65 sampled rows equal NCBI at
   that largest overlap byte for byte; in batches of several queries with weak HSPs
   (E-values near 1 to 10) LOSAT's output differs from NCBI's at the non-re-splitting
   overlaps by about as many weak HSPs as NCBI's outputs at two such overlaps differ from
   each other. Fixtures `env.resplit_*` (expected output from NCBI at that largest overlap,
   `oracle_env`).
   With a negative `CHUNK_SIZE` above a negative `OVERLAP_CHUNK_SIZE` the same failure is
   an explicit rejection (below).
2. **outfmt 0 titles made only of punctuation.** For a subject defline of commas,
   semicolons, tildes and spaces that ends in a run of spaces and separators (such as
   `, ,`), NCBI's `x_CleanAndCompress` (`create_defline.cpp:219-312`) lets its `size_t`
   count of the remaining letters wrap, reads past the end of the string and crashes when
   it writes the title of such a subject with hits (SIGSEGV). LOSAT stops the cleanup at
   the end of the string (`, ,` gives `, `). Evidence
   `docs/evidence/losat_web_e2g/punct_defline/`: 8 such deflines on subjects with hits,
   megablast and blastn, with and without `-max_target_seqs 3`; NCBI crashes in all 4
   runs; LOSAT's report equals NCBI's report for the same subjects with placeholder
   deflines once each placeholder is replaced by LOSAT's title. Subjects with such
   deflines and no hits, where NCBI runs, match NCBI (fixtures `punct.nohit_*`).

## Approved exceptions (TBLASTX and TBLASTN)

Version 1.2, accepted by the maintainer on 2026-10-03 in Session S08b (E2b), plan DW-17.

2. **outfmt 0 titles made only of punctuation** (BLASTN exception 2, extended). NCBI
   tblastx and tblastn build the outfmt 0 title of a nucleotide subject with the same
   `CDeflineGenerator` and `x_CleanAndCompress` (`create_defline.cpp:219-312`) and crash
   (SIGSEGV) on the same deflines when such a subject has hits; outfmt 6 and 7 do not build
   the title, and there NCBI and LOSAT agree. Evidence `docs/evidence/losat_web_e2b/`:
   `punct_defline.py` (deflines `, ,` and `;~ ;`: NCBI dies of the signal in outfmt 0,
   outfmt 6 and 7 equal), and the S08 audit (c), rounds 1 and 2: over all 15624 TBLASTX
   deflines of up to 6 and all 3124 TBLASTN deflines of up to 5 of `,;~ a` and space, NCBI
   crashes on 272 and 66, exactly those that LOSAT's test of such a title
   (`report/defline.rs` `ncbi_nucleotide_title_reads_past_end`) finds; the other reports are
   byte-identical. The approved result: LOSAT stops the cleanup at the end of the string, as
   for BLASTN. Implemented in Session S08+ (E2e; until then LOSAT rejected such subjects
   with hits in outfmt 0 explicitly) and checked as BLASTN's was: over all 1023 deflines of
   one to five of `,;~` and space, each TBLASTX and TBLASTN report equals NCBI's (957) or
   equals NCBI's report for the same subject with a placeholder defline once the
   placeholder is replaced by LOSAT's title (66, where NCBI crashes),
   `docs/evidence/losat_web_e2e/title_sweep.py`; fixtures `punct.tblastx` and
   `punct.tblastn` of `LOSAT/tests/outfmt0_manifest.tsv` (contract `approved_punct_title`).
   This records the implementation; the decision of version 1.2 is unchanged.

## BLASTP, TBLASTN and TBLASTX non-default options (version 1.3)

Version 1.3, accepted by the maintainer on 2026-10-05 in Session S08+b (E2e), plan DW-19:
the decisions D11 to D15 of `docs/evidence/losat_web_e2e/AUTHORITY.md` §M as recommended.

3. **Approved exception (BLASTP): a one-hit gapped start that reads past a sequence.**
   With `-window_size 0` (one-hit) and a low `-threshold`, NCBI's ungapped extension can
   give a negative `Int4` length that `BlastGetStartForGappedAlignment` receives as
   `Uint4` (`aa_ungapped.c:1054,1083`, `blast_gapalign.c:3393-3437`): it scores only the
   first window of 11 letters, and when that window passes the end of the query or the
   subject it reads past the sequence buffer and indexes the matrix with the stray byte;
   some such searches crash (SIGSEGV, exit 139; 21 of 5,000 random short searches with
   `-threshold` 1 to 3 in the round-2 audit). LOSAT reads the letters past the sequence
   as the sentinel (`NULLB`, `BLAST_SCORE_MIN`), as for the letter right after it. NCBI run
   under `valgrind -q`, which reports the invalid reads and does not crash, gives LOSAT's
   output byte for byte in all 23 crashing cases of the audit's second and third passes
   (`docs/evidence/losat_web_e2e/audit/round2/a2_blastp.md`, `a3_blastp.md`). Searches
   whose window stays inside the sequences and its sentinel match NCBI (fixture
   `e2e.blastp.one_hit_negative_width`).

Explicit rejections (rule 3):

- `-evalue` infinite or of DBL_MAX or more (BLASTP, TBLASTN; decision D12): a hit list
  whose HSPs all drop keeps the best e-value DBL_MAX, which passes `best_evalue <=
  expect_value` (`blast_kappa.c:409,3687`), and the empty list is read
  (`blast_hits.c:3266`): NCBI crashes on some inputs, and LOSAT cannot tell in advance
  which. `1.7976931348623156e308` and below run and match NCBI. TBLASTX runs these values
  and matches NCBI.
- Query-split settings that NCBI fails on (BLASTP, TBLASTN; decision D13): a
  `CHUNK_SIZE`/`OVERLAP_CHUNK_SIZE` pair with which a chunk would be split again, and a
  negative `CHUNK_SIZE` that splits a batch. Unlike BLASTN's exception 1, the maintainer
  kept the rejection for these programs.
- Settings on which NCBI crashes (decision D3): an IDENTITY word size of 5 or 6,
  `-use_sw_tback -ungapped -comp_based_stats 0`, compressed-lookup thresholds that
  exhaust its overflow bank, and `-max_target_seqs` values that make the preliminary hit
  list size not positive. A query length plus `-window_size` in (2^30, 2^31 - 1], where
  NCBI does not finish (decision D8).

Kept as explicit rejections although NCBI's result is deterministic (rule 2's
maintainer clause; decision D11): a query length plus `-window_size` above 2^31 - 1, where
NCBI's `Int4` diagonal table wraps to one cell and no hit is found (BLASTP, TBLASTX;
together with D8, every sum above 2^30 is rejected).

Reproduced as NCBI (rule 2): the out-of-range `double` to `Int4` conversions of
`-threshold` and the X-drops (INT_MIN, decision D4); `-max_target_seqs` of 2147483624 or
more in BLASTP, whose preliminary hit list size wraps to 2 to 48; TBLASTX's culling limit
plus 3 wrapping in `Int4` (decision D1).

## Reproduced as NCBI (rule 2)

- `CHUNK_SIZE=1000` without `BATCH_SIZE`: the batch size becomes 0, NCBI prints the
  outfmt 0 prolog and then `BLAST engine error: Empty CBlastQueryVector`, exit 3.
- `-max_target_seqs` from 2^30 to 2^31-51: the preliminary hit list size
  (`MIN(MAX(2*h,10),h+50)` in `Int4`) wraps and becomes 10.
- Defects without an effect on the output that LOSAT follows: the negative `Int4`
  offset of `BlastGetStartForGappedAlignmentNucl`, the out-of-range read of
  `hard_ranges[1]` for the last subject chunk, the out-of-range `double` to `Int4`
  conversion (INT_MIN), and the catch in `BlastSetupPreliminarySearchEx` that never
  matches.

## Explicit rejections (rule 3)

- A scoring system without Karlin-Altschul values when an invalid query (such as all N)
  comes first in its batch: NCBI goes on without a gapped block and crashes (SIGSEGV).
- `-max_target_seqs` above 2^31-51: the preliminary hit list size becomes negative and
  NCBI crashes.
- A reward of 32767 or a penalty of -32768 (after NCBI's 16-bit conversion):
  `BLAST_SCORE_MAX`/`BLAST_SCORE_MIN` fall outside NCBI's score range; a reward of 32767
  is counted past the end of the frequency array (invalid queries or a crash), a penalty
  of -32768 makes every query invalid. Version 1.1 (maintainer, 2026-10-02): a reward of
  32768 or more, which NCBI's 16-bit field wraps to 0 or below (NCBI: every query invalid,
  no hits, a deterministic result), stays an explicit rejection too.
- Subjects of 2^31 letters or more in total: NCBI's 32-bit total wraps.
- megablast gap costs above 32767: NCBI's 32-bit greedy distance arithmetic can wrap.
- A negative `CHUNK_SIZE` above a negative `OVERLAP_CHUNK_SIZE` that splits a query batch
  (`SplitQuery_CalculateNumChunks` gives more than one chunk): NCBI's `size_t` chunk ranges
  wrap; NCBI stops as in exception 1 where a chunk would be split again, and otherwise
  searches chunk ranges with gaps between them (hits are lost). Version 1.1 (maintainer,
  2026-10-02): the second case, although NCBI's result is deterministic, stays an explicit
  rejection (a setting without a practical use; reproducing it would need NCBI's wrapped
  `size_t` arithmetic through the chunk ranges, masks and merge). Where such a pair does
  not split the batch (for example `-1` above `-2147483648`), NCBI searches as without the
  variables and so does LOSAT (fixtures `env.negative_pair_*`).

- A `CHUNK_SIZE`/`OVERLAP_CHUNK_SIZE` pair whose chunk ranges leave a chunk without a
  query (an overlap close to or above the chunk size): NCBI's `CQuerySplitter::Split`
  (`split_query_cxx.cpp:872-880`) or the chunk's search stops with a null-pointer
  `CCoreException`; LOSAT rejects "a query chunk without a query" (round-3 audit: 27
  oracle cases, the reason holds in all).

## Ported (rule 4)

- `-evalue` with a signed infinity or NaN (`+inf`, `-nan`, `+nan(1)`, `1e999`): NCBI's
  `CArg_Double` reads them with `strtod` and its option check (`<= 0`) lets them pass;
  NCBI searches as with the largest e-value (the cutoff stays 1, no HSP is reaped). LOSAT
  rejected them before Session S07+++b.
